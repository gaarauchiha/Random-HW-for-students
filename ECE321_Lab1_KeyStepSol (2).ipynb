    "3. Select a sample rate $f_s$ that is close to the Nyquist rate and make a plot of 4 periods of this signal. Plot the signal versus the appropriate time axis (not sample number). Your plot should start at $t=0$. Indicate what sample rate you used to generate the plot.\n",
    "4. To make a sinusoidal plot that looks like a continuous-time signal, it is often necessary to sample a signal at a rate significantly higher than the Nyquist rate. Experiment with the sampling rate required to make a smooth plot of $x(t)$. Plot this highly sampled version on the same axes as the previous plot using a different line style. You should use the label command to label the two lines.\n",
    "5. Comment on the sampling rate required to make the signal appear continuous. In some applications, you will want to have a sampling rate high enough so that the plots are smooth, but not so high that it is a burden to process and/or store more samples than necessary. In future work, you will be expected to be able to select an appropriate sampling rate when creating plots of simulated continuous-time signals.\n"
